Moderation Review Lock
================================================
As soon as a :ref:`collection` status becomes in review, then its drafts are automatically locked. in the senes that their content can no longer be edited (not at all, not by anyone, not even the collection author). Also once a collection is in Review then content versions cannot be added to the collection. This means that once you’ve clicked “Submit for review”: 
 * New drafts cannot be added to the :ref:`collection`
 * Drafts in the :ref:`collection` cannot be edited unless rejected
